__In this pattern__: 
* there is a _subject_ and its _observers_
* The subject notifies the observers when something happens with its state
* "The observers are observing the subject" 

__I will implement:
* an observer interface
* some concrete observer-classes (A, B and C), implementing the observer interface
* A subject-class
